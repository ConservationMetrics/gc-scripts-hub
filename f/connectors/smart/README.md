# SMART

The SMART (Spatial Monitoring And Reporting Tool) platform consists of a set of software and analysis tools designed to help conservationists manage and protect wildlife and wild places. SMART can help standardize and streamline data collection, analysis, and reporting, making it easier for key information to get from the field to decision-makers.

For more information on SMART, see the [SMART website](https://www.smartconservationsoftware.org/) and [Technical Manuals](https://smartconservationtools.org/en-us/Resources/SMART-Manuals).
