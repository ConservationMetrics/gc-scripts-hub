# `gfw_alerts`: Download and Store Alerts from Global Forest Watch

This script can retrieve various types of alerts, such as GLAD and Integrated Forest Alerts, from the [Global Forest Watch Data API](https://data-api.globalforestwatch.org/), for a given bounding box. The alerts are then formatted as GeoJSON and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The script also saves the GeoJSON files to a specified directory for further use.

Currently, we support fetching the following alerts from GFW:

* [Integrated deforestation alerts](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::integrated-deforestation-alerts/about)
* [GLAD alerts](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/glad-forest-alerts) - either Landsat or Sentinel-2
* [RADD alerts](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::deforestation-alerts-radd/about)
* [NASA VIIRS fire alerts](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/documents/gfw::viirs-active-fires/about)

You can use these scripts to download data from GFW for your own analytical purposes, or to visualize them in a tool like QGIS or [Guardian Connector Explorer](https://github.com/conservationmetrics/gc-explorer). Please note that if you intend to use GC Explorer's Alert Dashboard view, your dataset should be relatively small (recommended: less than 1000 alerts). Datasets like deforestation alerts can be quite large depending on the area of interest and the time period, and may not be suitable for the Alert Dashboard view which is designed for smaller datasets.

> [!NOTE]
> This script makes a query request to conduct on-the-fly data analysis. This means that for large areas, it may take a while for the GFW API to return the result. Additionally, there is a **maximum allowed payload size of 6291556 bytes**.
>
> If we ever need to work around this payload size limit, we can use a [batch download endpoint](https://data-api.globalforestwatch.org/#tag/Query/operation/query_dataset_list_post_dataset__dataset___version__query_batch_post). This endpoint will provide a job ID, and trigger the query in the background. Once complete, accessing the job ID via a ` /job/{job_id}` endpoint will return a download link.

To use this script, **you need a valid API key from the GFW Data API**: See [Getting a GFW API Key](#getting-a-gfw-api-key) below.

## Getting a GFW API Key

These are the steps for getting a Global Forest Watch Data API key.

### 1. Sign up for a Resource Watch API account

https://api.resourcewatch.org/

### 2. Get a JWT token

https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/quickstart.html#2-obtain-your-jwt-for-authentication

This token will not expire unless you change your user information.

### 3. Get the GFW API key

https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/quickstart.html#3-create-your-application-and-get-your-api-key

```bash
curl -X POST "https://data-api.globalforestwatch.org/auth/apikey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" \
  -d '{
    "alias": "test-key",
    "email": "your-email@domain.com",
    "organization": "Your Organization Name",
    "domains": []}'
```

> [!NOTE] 
> The API key expires after one year. You will need to retrieve a new key afterwards. In the future, we can look at doing this programmatically.

## Getting a Bounding Box

Your bounding box needs to be in a three-ring format:

```json
[[[-180, -90], [-180, 90], [180, 90], [180, -90], [-180, -90]]]
```

If you don't already have a bounding box, you can use the following tool to get one: https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/

Draw a box on the map, and then change the format (in the dropdown on the bottom left corner) to "GeoJSON" and copy the coordinates.
