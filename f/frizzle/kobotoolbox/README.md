# KoboToolbox: Fetch Survey Responses

This script fetches form submissions from the KoboToolbox REST API, transforms the data for SQL compatibility, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it downloads any attachments and saves them to a specified directory.

For information on the KoboToolbox API, see [KoboToolbox API Documentation](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/api.html).
