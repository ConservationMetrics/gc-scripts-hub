# Frizzle: The Magic Data Bus

Frizzle is a collection of lightweight and flexible scripts, designed to enable seamless integration of multiple data sources.

These Frizzle scripts can fetch data from various upstream sources, such as KoboToolbox, CoMapeo, or Google Cloud Platform. Data from these sources is ingested in a consistent way. The scripts ensure that the data is cleansed, validated, and formatted appropriately before being transferred to its target destination, such as a SQL database, file storage, or other handling methods.

Using Windmill, the scripts can be scheduled to run at defined intervals, ensuring timely data processing.
